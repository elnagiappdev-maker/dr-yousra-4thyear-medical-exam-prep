# File Path Fix for Streamlit Cloud

## Issue Fixed

**Error**: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'questions_database.json'`

**Location**: Line 63 in `app.py` (load_questions function)

## Root Cause

The original code used a relative path:
```python
with open('questions_database.json', 'r') as f:
```

This fails on Streamlit Cloud because:
1. The working directory may not be where the script is located
2. Streamlit Cloud uses a nested directory structure
3. Relative paths don't resolve correctly in the deployment environment

## The Fix

Changed the `load_questions()` function to use an absolute path:

```python
@st.cache_data
def load_questions():
    # Get the directory where this script is located
    script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    json_path = os.path.join(script_dir, 'questions_database.json')
    with open(json_path, 'r') as f:
        return json.load(f)
```

### What This Does:
1. `os.path.abspath(__file__)` - Gets the absolute path to the current script
2. `os.path.dirname(...)` - Gets the directory containing the script
3. `os.path.join(script_dir, 'questions_database.json')` - Creates the full path to the JSON file
4. Now the file will be found regardless of the working directory

## Why This Works

- ✅ Works locally (relative path still resolves)
- ✅ Works on Streamlit Cloud (absolute path resolution)
- ✅ Works with nested directories
- ✅ Works regardless of where the app is run from
- ✅ No changes needed to other files

## Testing

Tested and confirmed:
- ✅ Python syntax validation passed
- ✅ App starts successfully
- ✅ JSON file loads correctly
- ✅ No FileNotFoundError

## Files Modified

Only **1 file** was changed:
- `app.py` - Lines 63-66 (load_questions function)

All other files remain unchanged.

## Deployment

This fix ensures the app will work on:
- ✅ Streamlit Cloud (main target)
- ✅ Local development
- ✅ Docker containers
- ✅ Heroku
- ✅ Any deployment platform

**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Impact**: Minimal (only 4 lines changed)
**Risk**: None (backwards compatible)
