# Fixes Applied to Repository

This document describes all the fixes and improvements made to the Medical Exam Prep repository.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Duplicate Nested Directories

**Problem**: The repository had multiple nested `med_exam_prep_streamlit` directories containing duplicate files.

**Solution**: Cleaned up the repository structure to have a flat, organized layout with all files in the root directory.

**Before**:
```
dr-yousra-4thyear-medical-exam-prep/
├── app.py
├── med_exam_prep_streamlit/
│   ├── app.py (duplicate)
│   └── med_exam_prep_streamlit/
│       └── app.py (duplicate)
```

**After**:
```
dr-yousra-4thyear-medical-exam-prep-fixed/
├── app.py
├── questions_database.json
├── requirements.txt
└── ... (all files in root)
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed runtime.txt Format

**Problem**: The `runtime.txt` file contained just "3.11" which is not the correct format for deployment platforms.

**Solution**: Updated to "python-3.11" which is the standard format expected by Streamlit Cloud and Heroku.

**Before**: `3.11`
**After**: `python-3.11`

### 3. ✅ Added Streamlit Configuration

**Problem**: No `.streamlit/config.toml` file existed for production configuration.

**Solution**: Created `.streamlit/config.toml` with optimized settings for:
- Theme colors matching the app design
- Server configuration for production
- Security settings (CORS, XSRF protection)
- Browser settings

### 4. ✅ Added Procfile for Heroku

**Problem**: Missing Procfile for Heroku deployment.

**Solution**: Created `Procfile` with proper Streamlit command for Heroku deployment.

### 5. ✅ Added GitHub Actions CI/CD

**Problem**: No automated testing despite documentation mentioning it.

**Solution**: Created `.github/workflows/tests.yml` that:
- Runs on every push and pull request
- Tests Python syntax
- Validates JSON database
- Tests Streamlit app startup

### 6. ✅ Added Setup Script

**Problem**: Manual setup process could be error-prone.

**Solution**: Created `setup.sh` script that:
- Checks Python installation
- Creates virtual environment
- Installs dependencies
- Provides clear instructions

## Files Added

1. **`.streamlit/config.toml`** - Streamlit configuration
2. **`Procfile`** - Heroku deployment configuration
3. **`setup.sh`** - Automated setup script
4. **`.github/workflows/tests.yml`** - CI/CD workflow
5. **`FIXES.md`** - This file documenting all changes

## Files Modified

1. **`runtime.txt`** - Fixed Python version format

## Files Preserved (No Changes)

All the following files work correctly and were preserved as-is:
- ✅ `app.py` - Main application (no syntax errors)
- ✅ `questions_database.json` - Valid JSON structure
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Proper dependencies
- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Correct Docker configuration
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Valid compose file
- ✅ `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide
- ✅ `GITHUB_SETUP.md` - GitHub setup guide
- ✅ `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Project summary
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ Python syntax validation - No errors
2. ✅ JSON validation - Valid structure
3. ✅ Streamlit app startup - Successful
4. ✅ All dependencies installable - Confirmed

## Deployment Ready

The fixed repository is now ready for deployment on:
- ✅ Streamlit Cloud
- ✅ Heroku
