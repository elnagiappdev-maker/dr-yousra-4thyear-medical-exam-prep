      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "ACE inhibitors like lisinopril provide superior renoprotection through multiple mechanisms: reducing intraglomerular pressure, decreasing proteinuria, and slowing progression of CKD. They are first-line agents in CKD with proteinuria.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "While amlodipine controls blood pressure, it lacks the specific renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors. Beta-blockers, hydralazine, and nifedipine do not provide equivalent renal protection in CKD."
